# SECURITY
Look, security vulnerabilities are not good, so if you discover a vulnerability, please
* Report - Report the vulnerability to a dev
* Keep It Safe - Don't exploit the vulnerability, well, at least don't do bad things with it.
* Try to patch it - If you have the skill to patch it, then feel free to do so, the faster it is fixed, the less time there is to exploit it.

Seriously, security vulnerabilities are dangerous, so it is important to be responsible about disclosing them.
